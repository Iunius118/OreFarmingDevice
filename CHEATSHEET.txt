- If the output slot fills up during operation, the products are ejected out of the block
- Hopper can be used to push materials and fuel into the device, and to pull products from the device
- Farming efficiency: appearance rate of ores increases with number of players, villagers, etc. (up to 3) around the device (5x3x5)
- The appearance of the OF Device block can be changed using a stick

- Recycling recipe (crafting): OF C Feeder I + Bucket -> Lava Bucket

### OF C Feeder II

- Recipe (crafting): OF C Feeder I + Diamond Pickaxe
- Recipe (smithing): Paper + OF C Feeder I + Diamond Pickaxe
- Improved version of Feeder I with no increase in fuel consumption

## Config

The default config file is saved to the following path:

- `<instance_path>/config/orefarmingdevice-server.toml`

Restart the game when you change the config. In multiplayer mode, server-side config will be used.

- isCobblestoneFeederAvailable (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether OF Cobblestone Feeder is available for devices
- enableFarmingEfficiency (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether mobs around device increase farming efficiency of device
- accelerateProcessingSpeedByMod (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether to accelerate processing speed of device by modification
- increaseFuelConsumptionByMod (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether to increase fuel consumption of device by modification

## Modifying Product Tables

The products and their probabilities of each device can be modified using loot table in data pack.
JSON files for the loot tables corresponding to each device are as follows.

Here is the formula for the corrected weight: `weight + (farming_efficiency * quality)`.

OF Device:

- Cobblestone:       `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_0.json`
- Cobbled deepslate: `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_0_d.json`
- Netherrack:        `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_0_n.json`

OF Device Mod 1:

- Cobblestone:       `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_1.json`
- Cobbled deepslate: `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_1_d.json`
- Netherrack:        `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_1_n.json`

OF Device Mod 2:

- Cobblestone:       `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_2.json`
- Cobbled deepslate: `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_2_d.json`
- Netherrack:        `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_table/device_2_n.json`
