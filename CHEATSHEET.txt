## Config

`(world_save_dir)/serverconfig/orefarmingdevice-server.toml`

Restart the game when you change the config. In multiplayer mode, server-side config will be used.

- isCobblestoneFeederAvailable (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether OF C Feeders are available for devices
- enableFarmingEfficiency (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether mobs around device increase farming efficiency of device
- accelerateProcessingSpeedByMod (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether to accelerate processing speed of device by modification
- increaseFuelConsumptionByMod (boolean, default value is true)
  - Whether to increase fuel consumption of device by modification

## Modifying Product Tables

The products and their probabilities of each device can be modified using loot table in data pack.
JSON files for the loot tables corresponding to each device are as follows.

Here is the formula for the corrected weight: `weight + (farming_efficiency * quality)`.

OF Device:

- Cobblestone:       `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_0.json`
- Cobbled deepslate: `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_0_d.json`
- Netherrack:        `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_0_n.json`

OF Device Mod 1:

- Cobblestone:       `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_1.json`
- Cobbled deepslate: `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_1_d.json`
- Netherrack:        `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_1_n.json`

OF Device Mod 2:

- Cobblestone:       `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_2.json`
- Cobbled deepslate: `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_2_d.json`
- Netherrack:        `(data_pack_root)/data/orefarmingdevice/loot_tables/device_2_n.json`
